/**
 *                                  REQUIREMENTS OF THE ASSIGNMENT 
 * 
 * Provide a parallel version of the Tarjan's algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components in 
 * a Graph. The implementation MUST use an hybrid message passing / shared memory paradigm. and 
 * has to be implemented by using MPI and openMP. Students MUST provide parallel processes on 
 * different nodes, and each process has to be parallelized by using Open MP (i.e.: MPI will spawn 
 * OPENMP-compiled processes). Students can choose the graph allocation method the prefer. They can 
 * eventually produce the graph directly in distributed memory (without store anything). Good Graph 
 * dimensions are greater than 4GB of data.
 * 
 * @file GraphGenerator.h
 * 
 * @brief This file contains a function for generating a graph and storing it in a file.

 * @version 0.1
